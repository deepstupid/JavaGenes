/**
 * this fitness function is a product of fitness functions times their weights with one added to
 * the fitness.  One is the minimum fitness (the objectives are assumed to have positive fitness).
 * Weights are generally expected be less than one, although that is not required.  If the weighted
 * fitenss before adding one is smaller than one, then the weight will have a strong effect on
 * the total fitness.  If the weighted fitness before adding one is large, then the scaling by
 * weight will have little effect.
 * <p>
 * One is added because the best fitness is assumed to be zero and multiplication changes
 * direction when below one.
 * <p>
 * This approach was recommended by Greg Hornby
